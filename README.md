### Image Captioning
#### Coco Dataset for Captioning

Images features, dim=4096, are extracted from the fc7 layer of the VGG-16 network pretrained on ImageNet (not COCO).
And further, a dimensionality reduced version with dim=512 is generated by PCA.

Word to integer index and integer index to word mappings are stored in a JSON file.
4 special tokes are added, `<START>`, `<END>`, `<UNK>` for out-of-vocab words, and `<NULL>` for padding.


#### RNN and LSTM Captioning

Vanilla RNN and LSTM are implemented using purely Numpy.

The experiments overfit 50 training data points from COCO. Somehow in this setup, the LSTM's performance is not as good as RNN.


#### Transformer Captioning

The transformer for image captioning is decoder only. Because the image features are used as output of encoder, and are attended at every decoder layer (block).
Each decoder block has 4 layers, a self-attention layer, a multi-head attention layer (to attend image features), followed by two linear layers. 

At training time, for each caption x, `x[:-1]` is used as input, and `x[1:]` is the target. `x[:-1]` goes through an embedding layer and positional embedding layer before feeding into the first decoder layer.
The captions in a batch are packed with the token `<NULL>` so they have the same length. The `<NULL>` tokens do not contribute to loss and as a result no gradients.

At test time (sampling), the first input is the `<START>` token, and tokens generated at each step are concatenated together and fed back as input until we have reached the `max_len` number of tokens or `<END>` is produced. 

### GAN

The objective function $\displaystyle \min_G \max_D E_{x \sim p_{data}}[logD(x)] + E_{z \sim p(z)}[log(1 - D(G(z)))]$ 
works well with Discriminator D but has a problem in optimizing Generator G.
At the start of training, $G(z)$ generates roughly random noise, therefore $D(G(z))$ is close to 0. This means  $-log(1 - D(G(z)))$ is close to 0 too, and the gradients propagated back to generator $G$ is very small.
But if we use objective function  $\displaystyle \max_GE_{z \sim p(z)}[log(D(G(z)))]$, when $D(G(z))$ is close to 0, $-log(D(G(z)))$ is a big number, which generates strong gradients back to G.

Least squares GAN found the vanilla GAN's sigmoid cross-entropy loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. The paper proposed to use least square loss function, and showed that it can stablize training and generate better images. The discriminator optimizer pushes $D(x)$ to 1 where $x \sim p_{data}$ and $D(G(z))$ to zero, whereas the generator optimizer wants to push $D(G(z))$ to 1.

### Self-supervised Learning

Self-supervised learning allows a model to learn and generate a "good" representation vector for images. "Good" means images in the dataset representing **semantically** similar entities should have similar representation vectors, and different images should have different representation vectors. The learnt model performs well even on new datasets the model was not trained on.

It looks to me the authors were trying to generate image representation via self-supervised training like what BERT did. They cleverly construct "labels" by random data augmentation.

The loss function is also well-designed that cannot only push positive pairs closer but also push negative pairs apart.


## Resnet for CIFAR-10

I implemented a Resnet model for CIFAR-10 by following the [original resnet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The implementation strictly follows section 4.2 of the paper. 

Specifically, the input layer is a 3 x 3 convolutional layer with 16 filters. Then the model has a stack of 6n layers (n = 3 in this case). All conv layers are 3 x 3 convolutions on the feature map sizes {32, 16, 8} respectively, with 2n layers for each feature map size. The number of filters are {16, 32, 64} respectively. 
The residual connection uses option A described in the paper, i.e. use stride=2 Max pooling, and pad zeros for increased dimensions.
The last is a feedforward layer with 10 output classes.

So in total there are 20 layers, with 269914 (0.27 MB) parameters.
The validation and test accuracy on CIFAR-10 are between 91.5-92.0 %, consistent with the paper.

It is pretty cool that such a small network has so good performance.
